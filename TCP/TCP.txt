1. Develop a client-server application using TCP where the client will send a message to the
server and the server will reply back to the client with another message. This communication
will continue until the client sends a particular string to the server.

2. Develop a client-server application using TCP where the client will send two operands and an
operator to the server in operand1 operator operand2 format and the server will calculate the
result and display it. Allowed operators are +, -, *, /, %.

3. Develop a Client-Server application using TCP where the client will send two words to the
server and the server will check whether same characters are present in both the words and
they occur same number of times (irrespective of position of the characters) and send back the
result to the client. The client will display the result.
[Example: Input: listen silent, Output: Check condition satisfied.]

4. Develop a Client-Server application using TCP where the client will send two file names to the
server and the server will copy the content of the first file into the second file. After copying is
done, the server will send appropriate message to the client. The second file should be initially
empty. Assume that both files are present at the server.

5. Develop a client-server application using TCP where the client sends the name of a text file
and size of the block of data to the server, the server checks availability of the text file and if
the text file is available, sends the text file content to the client as per the input block size after
reading the file contents. After sending the whole file, display appropriate message.
